This is the base system. Rootfs is assembled here as a plaintext Ext4 image.
Runtime system configuration (what to run on which VTs, services etc) comes
from rootfs-dropin.

Initrd is packed with block drivers, and uses findblk to locate the root
device. Nothing fancy, and this is also what most non-encrypted installation
using minibase would probably use.

Bootloader (syslinux) is used to load kernel+initrd with either BIOS and UEFI.
For UEFI only, it would probably be better to append initrd to EFI-stubbed
kernel and let the firmware boot that directly, but there's Qemu which only
really does BIOS well, and one of my test devices is BIOS-only as well.
Syslinux loads kernel and initrd the same way in both cases.
