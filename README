This repository contains build scripts and filesystem skeletons for
bootable minibase images. There are two of them currently, encrypted
and non-encrypted, both based on Buildroot. When built, the images
will contain just enough to run Weston and (if the hardware is present)
connect to a wifi network.

The images can be used with qemu, or with an Intel-based laptop capable
of booting in BIOS mode.

WARNING: buildroot takes a lot of time and about 6GB of space to build.


System contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The resulting images contain
	
	* ~3MB kernel
	* ~6MB of kernel modules
	* ~11MB of firmware for iwlwifi (6000 and 8000 series)
	* ~550KB of minibase tools
	* ~1MB musl+busybox
	* about 30MB of weston and its dependencies

Ignoring root shells (which shouldn't be there in a real system),
the `weston` executable is the first one to load libc during boot.


Pre-built images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Check Releases tab, and skip to Booting with qemu below.


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The host system need a usable GNU toolchain:

	* common POSIX tools
	* binutils, gcc, make
	* wget to download the sources

Also must be available:

	* mtools
	* syslinux, with files in /usr/share/syslinux
	  (fix the scripts if the files are in another location)

Buildroot could be used to build both, but most system have them as packages
anyway so why bother.


How to build the images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download https://buildroot.org/downloads/buildroot-2017.08.tar.bz2,
unpack it and rename the directory into ./buildroot.

# If the host system runs glibc-2.26:
#
#	cp brvendor/package/flex/0002*.patch buildroot/package/flex/
#
# otherwise the build will fail.

Clone (or download and unpack) https://github.com/arsv/minibase to ./minibase.
Build minibase:

	cd minibase
	./configure
	make
	make install    # this will install into ./out

Build the rest of the buildroot system:

	cd buildroot
	make BR2_EXTERNAL=../brvendor minibase_defconfig
	make            # this will take lots of time

Assemble plaintext image:

	cd sys-plain
	make

Assemble encrypted image:

	cd sys-crypt
	make

The first sys-crypt build will generate image encryptions keys which will
then be re-used unless removed manually. The tool will ask for passphrase
when generating the keys, and then once again to unlock the keys when
encrypting the image. Any subsequent run will only ask for passphrase to
unlock the keys.


System structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the end of the build, the complete contents of initrd, bootfs and rootfs
will be in respective directories. Feel free to investigate them.

The kernel invokes initrd/init on startup. That script in turn execs into
rootfs/sbin/system/start which is a script as well.

The system is assembled by merging the contents of minibase/out,
buildroot/output/target, and dropin/. The first two provide executables while
the files from dropin determine system configuration.


Booting with qemu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run xqemu.sh in respective directories:

	cd sys-plain
	./xqemu.sh

The scripts will attempt to run qemu with -enable-kvm. Remove that option
if KVM is not available, but be prepared for nearly unusable system. Weston
is *really* slow. Without KVM, it may take more than 5s to start and it will
look like the system is hung up. It's not, it's just Weston grinding its gears.

Password for sys-crypt is "swordfish".


Booting with real hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write the image onto usb stick:

	cd sys-crypt
	dd if=whole.img of=/dev/sdb   # make sure it's the right device

and try to persuade hw's firmware to boot from that. The image is a regular
BIOS/MBR boot image with two partitions and syslinux for bootloader.


Getting around the system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The system is configured to be usable in qemu. VT switch combos are C-Fx,
not C-A-Fx as usual.

The system should boot into Weston running on VT3. Tap C-F4 to switch to
another Weston instance (starting it if necessary) on VT4. Tap C-F2 for a
root console. There's another root console on ttyS0 (serial). In qemu,
press C-A-3 to access it.

Use `svctl` to query top-level supervisor:

	svctl                  # process list
	svctl -t udevmod       # stop udevmod
	svctl -s udevmod       # start it again
	svctl -P               # poweroff

Use `vtctl` to control vtmux:

	vtctl 4                # switch to VT4

Use `wictl` to scan/connect to network:

	wictl -s               # scan wifi
	wictl -p blackhole     # ask passphrase and connect to a named AP

The above only works if there are any wifi devices available. Wired interfaces
may be queries and initialized using ifctl:

	ifctl                  # show networking devices
	ifctl -a [dev]         # bring up and dhpc dev

The interactive shell is busybox sh, and there's a bunch of common commands
provided by busybox as well.

Tap C-Esc to bring up control VT. Shift-R to reboot, Shift-P to poweroff etc.

If running on real hardware, press C-Power to power the system off, and hold
C-A-Del for about a second to reboot.


Bootloading
~~~~~~~~~~~
The images use syslinux for bootloader. Legacy/BIOS should work.
UEFI mode *may* work, or it may not. UEFI boot should *not* be expected
to work in qemu due to bootloader limitations.

There is absolutely nothing minibase-specific about booting the system,
any configuration that will get the kernel and initrd into the memory
should work. Feel free to experiment.

The system uses MBR ID 0x11223344 to find its boot media.


Troubleshooting and caveats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Errors at "Waiting for devices" stage indicate lack of necessary modules,
especially USB-related.

Weston may not display cursor in qemu upon boot. Try switching VTs (C-Esc
or C-F2 or C-F4, then C-F3) to force reinitialization. Not a minibase issue
as far as I can tell at this point. Should work much better on real hardware.

Weston degrades into unusable mess when running in non-KVM qemu. Apparently
slow emulated CPU breaks some frame sync assumptions. Without KVM, it may
also take something like 5+ seconds to start, showing blank screen in process.

The kernel is configured for the hardware I have at hand. Feel free
to reconfigure if necessary. Sadly enabling everything is not an option
for a system that aims to be "small". Full set of iwlwifi firmware alone
takes more space than the whole userspace including Weston.
